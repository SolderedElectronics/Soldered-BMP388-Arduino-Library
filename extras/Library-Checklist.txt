✅ | Make coffee
❌ | Create repo from https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Generic-easyC, be sure to check "Include all branches"
    | Be sure to name it Soldered-[sensor name]-Arduino-Library
❌ | Checkout dev branch and make changes here only.
❌ | Rename src/Generic-easyC-SOLDERED.h/.cpp to src/[sensor name]-SOLDERED.h/.cpp
❌ | Change #include "Generic-easyC-SOLDERED.h" to #include "[sensor name]-SOLDERED.h" in [sensor name]-SOLDERED.cpp
❌ | Make sure you've renamed header guard to something unique too.
❌ | Change Sensor class in the same file to [sensor name] and all the constructors too
❌ | Write firmware for Attiny if necessary
❌ | Write an API wrapper (add native contructor and initializeNative functions if native is supported)
    | For only easyC sensors, 
        - constructor is only constructor()
        - begin is begin() which default adress to 0x30 and begin(address)
    | For only native sensors:
        - constructor is only constructor(pins...)
        - begin is only begin()
    | For both native and easyC
        - constructors are constructor() and constructor(pins...)
        - begin is begin() or begin(address)
    | (easyC class has all except constructor(pins...) which are stored in sensor class itself, excess functions should be commented out)
    | use native flag if native constructor is called
❌ | Document library code using doxygen tags (set PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER and PROJECT_BRIEF)
❌ | Write some basic examples and document them as in example Template, be sure to change @file tag to new example name too
    | Be sure to add lots of comments
    | In every example add link to the board page using format solde.red/[sku]
    | Get board sku here:
        - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OgNTXLb2BICWH0ZpkS87TvWyUalTrakakhnibQFRWnQ/edit?usp=sharing
❌ | Fill in README.md
    | Be sure to change

    | Also change link to docs to the one provided by GH-pages
❌ | If ATtiny firmware not used in this library, be sure to remove.
        - in README
            [![ATtiny Firmware Compile Test](https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-Generic-Arduino-Library/actions/workflows/attiny_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=dev)](https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/Soldered-Generic-Arduino-Library/actions/workflows/attiny_test.yml)
            attiny_test.yml in .github/workflows folder
❌ | If ATtiny firmware is used in this library, open .github/workflows and open attiny_test.yml.
        - Change fqbn: Dasduino_Boards:megaavr:easyc:chip=404 to suit your setup (change the value written in chip field. 404 means it is used ATtiny404).
        - If needed, add libraries to the compile test (or add them into attiny_firmware sketch folder)
❌ | Fill in keywords.txt with added function names
❌ | Fill in library.properties with:
    | Library name
    | Describe library with a sentence and a paragraph
    | Change category accordingly
    | Change main .h file to [sensor name]-SOLDERED.h
❌ | Update Doxyfile with
    | PROJECT_NAME   - to [sensor name]
    | PROJECT_NUMBER - to 1.0.0
    | PROJECT_BRIEF  - same as library.properties paragraph
❌ | Update @authors to your name in all source files (search and replace in vsc works fine)
❌ | Push to dev
    | Check if Github Actions made a push to main
❌ | Set GitHub pages settings
    | Visit https://github.com/SolderedElectronics/[repo name]/settings/pages
    | Change to gh-pages branch and /docs folder
❌ | Check if docs are made correctly
❌ | Check if Board Compatibility test is passing for all boards
❌ | Check if Arduino Library Manager Compatibility Test is passing
❌ | Make a release with version 1.0.0
❌ | PR to Arduino Library Manager if not done already
